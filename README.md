C PROGRAMMING  PRACTICE  REPOSITORY

Welcome to my C Programming repository! This repository contains various C programs that I have written while learning and practicing the C programming language. Each program addresses specific concepts, data structures, and algorithms, with a focus on strengthening foundational programming skills.

Contents
Here are some of the types of programs included:

Basic Programs - Covering fundamental C concepts like arithmetic operators, loops, conditionals, and arrays.
Data Structures - Implementations of stacks, queues, and double-ended queues (dequeues).
Memory Management - Programs demonstrating dynamic memory allocation.
Algorithms - Programs related to sorting, searching, and other core algorithms.
Additional Projects - Any other standalone C projects or experiments I work on.
